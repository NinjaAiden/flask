    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
    Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family 
    inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
    when Smaug came and took it.)
    Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the 
    Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that
    stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could
    keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. 
    The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number,
    and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the
        Mountain King, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and

        lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading
